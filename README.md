# WebcamDroid

Given how all the android apps I found that could turn your phone into a webcam were either shady or paid, I decided to do it myself. Using my phone, I was able to receive the RTSP stream broadcasted via VLC player. However, because of increasing exam commitments at that time, I stopped working on it. I will probably not be working on this again any time soon, but if possible, I want to make the video res selection fragment work and actually code a RTSP to webcam client.
